# Coordination-between-autonomous-vehicles
In the following project, I implemented an algorithm in order to coordinate between multiple autonomous vehicles so as to avoid crashes between them and allow them to
reach their destinations as fast as possible. I also implemented a visualization interface using the Turtle module in python to see the algorithm in action.
The algorithm roughly speaking involves the approximation of the field by a randomly generated graph, then finding the shortest path from start to finish for each vehicle, and finally coordinate between them, thus avoiding their intersections using a dynamic programming approach.
